                    EduPDFâ€™s MCQ Generation feature allows users to 
                    generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) either 
                    for a specific topic or directly from an uploaded 
                    PDF document. By analyzing the provided content, 
                    it automatically identifies key concepts and 
                    transforms them into relevant MCQs. The MCQs 
                    generated can be customized in terms of difficulty 
                    level making it a versatile solution for various subjects.
